# Slicer Estimator - a generic implementation for an accurate remaining time
With this plugin and active Post Processing in e.g. Cura you will get an exact estimation of time remaining as it will set from information analysed in the slicer. So it will be very accurate. Thanks to arhi for the idea and first implementation.

You can select a predefined slicer or change configuration according your needs.

## Requirement
 * Needs M73 and M117 codes in your GCODE. As percentage done is not processed further it is not really necessary.
 * You have to add Cura Post Processing Script and activate "Time Remaining" to add necessary information to GCODE file.

## Notes
 * In case there are no matching M73 or M117 codes the original estimator from OctoPrint will be used
 * In case SDCARD print is used the original estimator from OctoPrint will be used
 * For known slicers only the slicer has to be selected and the slicers Post Processing has to be set correctly.

 Example for custom configuration: For the following command "M117 100% Remaining 1 weeks 6 days ( 07:54:19 )" you can use RegEx "M117 .+ Remaining ([0-9]+) weeks.+" with Match 1 to get the weeks. To get the minutes you should use "M117 .+ Remaining .+\( ([0-9]+):([0-9]+):([0-9]+) \)" and Match 2 to avoid an issue if weeks are not shown. 

I like to suggest regex101.com for testing and to get the right match group.

More configurations can be added, please request additions via a [Github issue](https://github.com/NilsRo/OctoPrint-SlicerEstimator/issues).
